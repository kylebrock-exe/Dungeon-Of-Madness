# Dungeon-Of-Madness
A simple console RPG created by Kyle Brock for Code Louisville's September 2020 C# Program.
In this RPG you will cycle through random encounters with many foes and magical beasts! 
I have implemented a Master Loop that the player will stay as they encounter monsters, but can also save and buy upgrades at the Shop.
Through the use of a switch the program is able to randomly select monsters and encounters for the player to have. 

The solution is located in the Master branch.
