# Dungeon-Of-Madness
A simple console RPG created by Kyle Brock for Code Louisville's September 2020 C# Program.
In this RPG you will cycle through random encounters with many foes and magical beasts!
The goal of this game is to purchase at least five of the "Difficulty" items from the shop in order to confront the the final foe.
I have implemented a Master Loop that the player will stay as they encounter monsters, but can also save and buy upgrades at the Shop.
Through the use of a switch the program is able to randomly select monsters and encounters for the player to have. The game has the ability to store save files for the players so that they can continue their game from where they left off. It features several upgrades the player can buy in the shop to increase their attack and defense. 

The solution is located in the Master branch.
